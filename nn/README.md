Neural nets (weights saved in model____.h5 files), with the appropriate structure (sigmoid or relu activation functions, differing layers and neurons)
All are feed forward (data set too small to warrant convolutional networks)

useModel.py is for the WIP in the web folder, gives back the predicted outcome for the array input

WIP:
Manually build nn with numpy
